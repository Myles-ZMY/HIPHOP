# HIPHOP

## Overview

This is the matlab implementation of the HIPHOP feature. HIPHOP feature is a person re-identification feature propopsed in [‚ÄùPerson Re-Identification by Camera Correlation Aware Feature Augmentation"][http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7849147/]. Note that this implementation requires [caffe][http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org] and its matlab interface.

## How to use

"demo.m" is the entrance script. Please run it with matlab to see the pipeline of our system. You can use "matlabpool" for parallel computing.

Note that if the dimension is too large for computation, you can use PCA for dimensional reduction.
